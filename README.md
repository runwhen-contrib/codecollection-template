# codecollection-template
A hello-world-style template for codecollection authors to get started writing codebundles. This template contains the minimum file structure expected by the RunWhen platform.

[![Build](https://github.com/runwhen-contrib/codecollection-template/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/runwhen-contrib/codecollection-template/actions/workflows/build.yaml)

## Getting Started
Looking to be a contributor for CodeCollections or start your own? We'd love to collaborate! Head on over to our [public docs](https://docs.runwhen.com/public/v/runwhen-authors/codecollection-development/getting-started/running-your-first-codebundle) to get started.

File Structure overview of devcontainer:
```
-/app/
    |- auth/ #store secrets here, it should already be properly gitignored for you
    |- codecollection/
    |   |- codebundles/ # stores codebundles that can be run
    |   |- libraries/ # stores python keyword libraries used by codebundles
    |- dev_facade/ # provides interfaces equivalent to those used on the platform, but just dry runs the keywords to assist with development
    ...
```

The included script `ro` wraps the `robot` RobotFramework binary, and includes some extra functionality to write logs to a consistent location for viewing in a HTTP server at http://localhost:3000/ that is always running as part of the devcontainer.

### Quickstart

Navigate to the codebundle directory
`cd codecollection/codebundles/hello_world/`

Run the codebundle
`ro sli.robot`
